## The Bodyguard

When the president's plane crash-landed into enemy territory, only the president and one bodyguard survived. 
The opposing forces have the park surrounded and are closing in. Hopefully the bodyguard can keep him safe.

### About the Game

This game was a solo submission for the **2023 Ludum Dare Game Jam**, which was my first game jam I participated in without a team. 
Ludum Dare 54 ran from Friday September 29th to Monday October 2nd, 2023, and had the theme of **Limited Space**. 
This game, **completed in 48 hours**, fits the theme as the bodyguard and president face a constrained, shrinking space as the enemies surround the duo in the park.

This game was made with Unity and programmed in C#, with all the artwork being made by me in Aseprite.
