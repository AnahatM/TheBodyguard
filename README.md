## The Bodyguard

When the president's plane crash-landed into enemy territory, only the president and one bodyguard survived. 
The opposing forces have the park surrounded and are closing in. Hopefully the bodyguard can keep him safe.

### About the Game

This game was a solo submission for the **2023 Ludum Dare Game Jam**, which was my first game jam I participated in without a team. 
Ludum Dare 54 ran from Friday September 29th to Monday October 2nd, 2023, and had the theme of **Limited Space**. 
This game, **completed in 48 hours**, fits the theme as the bodyguard and president face a constrained, shrinking space as the enemies surround the duo in the park.

This game was made with Unity and programmed in C#, with all the artwork being made by me in Aseprite.

### How to Play

_(There's also an in-game tutorial.)_

The game is playable online or can be downloaded for Windows.

You play as the bodyguard of the president, who follows you wherever you go. 
Eliminating threats will give you money, which you can use to purchase new weapons and upgrades from the shop. 
You can upgrade things such as the president's armor, speed, or health. 
When you purchase a weapon, click on it on the left side of the screen in order to select it.
